🚀 AI-Powered Job Scheduling System for Companies
🧩 Overview

The AI-Powered Job Scheduling System is a smart web-based platform designed to help companies efficiently assign jobs to employees. It uses machine learning algorithms to match tasks with the most suitable employees based on their skills, workload, and performance, reducing manual work and improving productivity.

🧠 Key Features

👩‍💻 Employee Management – Add, update, and manage employees with their skills and availability.

📝 Task Management – Create, assign, and update tasks with priority and deadlines.

🤖 AI-Based Assignment – Automatically assigns tasks to employees using clustering and optimization logic.

⚖ Workload Balancing – Detects overload and suggests reassignments for fair distribution.

📊 Performance Tracking – Tracks completed tasks, speed, and accuracy for performance evaluation.

📈 Admin Dashboard – Provides visual analytics using Chart.js for workload and performance reports.

AI Service: Implements clustering and optimization algorithms for smart assignment.

🧠 Example Algorithm (Pseudocode)
Input: New task with required skills
For each employee:
    Calculate skill match score
    Check current workload and availability
    Compute performance rating
Select employee with highest total score
Assign task and update workload

💡 Expected Outcomes

Reduced manual task allocation

Balanced workload among employees

Improved overall productivity and task completion rate

Better visibility of employee performance
